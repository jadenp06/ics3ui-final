# *ICS-3UI Final Project: Stalingrad: 1943*
### *By Jaden Pereira*

The goal of this project is to create a classic 2D arcade style shooter game, based on previous World War 2 themed arcade games such as *Midway: 1942*. This game, *Stalingrad: 1943*, will be themed after the Battle of Stalingrad, with the player controlling a Soviet Yak-3 and being tasked with fending off waves of German fighters and bombers. The game will be very easy to play as the controls are extremely simple, with the player only needing their mouse to play the game. The player’s plane tracks the cursor’s position, meaning movement is seamless and easier than a joystick or key-based system. Shooting also relies on the mouse, with any mouse input (left, right, roller) being able to fire the gun. It is recommended that the player use a separate mouse when playing as it makes the experience better, however trackpad can still be used.
